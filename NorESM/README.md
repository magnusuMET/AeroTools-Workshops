# NorESM AeroTools workshop

Here you can find the files associated with the NorESM AeroTools workshop, first held 22.03.2024. The lectures assume that you have access to Lustre/PPI

Each folder holds a separate lecture, in the form of a jupyter notebook. Most of the notebooks can be used to run the tutorial code directly, while some notebooks have command line code, which has to be run in the terminal.
